## Issue Present
The computer hardware industry is constantly evolving, and so are the software or games that depend on it. People who use computers for different goals, such as learning data science or computer science, or enjoying new games,

There is a limitless demand for this business. But they also face two significant obstacles: the high price and the complex process of selecting and building their dream computer with the best parts.

## Our goal
Our clients can save both time and money with our services. We offer to upgrade their computers and take their old parts in exchange for a discount. We serve both home users with minor changes and large corporations that require hardware at a large scale.

### `Saves time, Saves budget, Saves the environment

## Why us?
We use the latest AI technology to constantly monitor the prices of all parts and store them in our database. We train our AI to optimize the energy efficiency and performance of the parts according to the needs of the users. Our AI can provide a reliable solution in 5 seconds. We also offer video tutorials on how to install different parts. If the users need more help, we can video chat with them and guide them step by step. If the installation is still not possible, we can send our regional technicians to the location of the users' choice. We create thousands of jobs with our service. We also protect the environment by reusing old parts. We also care about the environment and prevent the waste of resources by reusing old parts.
